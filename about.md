My name is Clavianus Juneardo, known as Clavin June. I was born in Tangerang, Indonesia on 28 of June 1998. As a developer, I focus on web development. I write blog posts about web development. Even though I was born as a native Indonesian, I understand English on a business level and a bit Japanese.
